## Unreal Projects

### **Boids** 
A C++ Unreal implementation of simple boid behaviour based on the principles described by the following wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids

Three key steps in the algorithm:

(1) Alignment:

	-			Steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
	
(2) Separation:

	-			Steer to avoid local flockmates
	
(3) Cohesion:

	-			Steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
