## Rules


### Tile Types

Black Tile:

  - The black tile is the end point of the level. It is the player's goal to make it here.

Bridge Tile:

  - The bridge tile can open new paths but must be activated by a switch!

Fall/Red Tile:

  - These tiles will fall whenever the player character is standing on top of them.

Torus Tile:
  - The torus tile splits your character into two at puts them at different points of the map.

Circle switches:

  - Circle switches are activated whenever the character is over them regardless if the character is flat or standing.

Cross switches:

  - Cross switches are activated whenever the character is standing over them. If the character is flat, the switch does 
    not react.

### Movement Counter

The amount of moves the player makes in each level is stored and used to calculate their overall score at the end (score feature is not yet implemented).

If the player falls, then the move count is reset to whatever it was at the beginning of the level.

# **Boids** 
A C++ Unreal implementation of simple boid behaviour based on the principles described by the following wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids

Three key steps in the algorithm:

1. Alignment:

- Steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
	
2. Separation:

- Steer to avoid local flockmates
	
3. Cohesion:

- Steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
